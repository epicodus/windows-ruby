# Installing Ruby on Windows

The sad truth of the matter is that Ruby is not well-supported on Windows.
There are numerous approaches to installing Ruby on Windows.
Each has their advantages and disadvantages.

If you'd like to add an approach not listed below, please open a pull request.



## Nitrous.io

Download: Use online at https://www.nitrous.io/.

Advantages: No installation. Everything is pre-configured and ready to go.

Disadvantages: Text editor isn't the greatest. Requires internet. Is only as fast as your internet connection.


## Install Linux

Download: http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop

Advantages: Get a real Unix environment where Ruby is well-supported.

Disadvantages: Installing can be very difficult, can brick your computer, and/or can cause data loss. You have to learn a new operating system.


## RubyInstaller

Download: http://rubyinstaller.org/

Advantages: Lightweight: just includes Ruby.

Disadvantages: You must also install DevKit (available from the same site). Some gems are tough to install.


## RailsInstaller

Download: http://railsinstaller.org/

Advantages: Includes everything you need to get going with Rails.

Disadvantages: Opinionated stack. Installs tools you don't necessarily need. Was stagnant for very long but recently updates. We will see if it becomes more actively maintained.
